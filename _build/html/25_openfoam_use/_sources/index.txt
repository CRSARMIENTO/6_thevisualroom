Notes on CFD, Computing and Mathematics
=======================================

This website was written as a record of my self-taught approach to certain aspects of engineering, as I continue to develop my skills and knowledge.

Notes on CFD
============

These notes are based on the MOOCs "Computational Fluid Dynamics" by `Professor Lorena Barba <http://www.seas.gwu.edu/lorena-barba>`_ and "High Performance Scientific Computing" by `Professor Randall LeVeque <http://depts.washington.edu/amath/staff-members/randy-leveque/>`_. The rest of the notes are based on literature from variously quoted academic resources and personal notes I have made.

Notes on Computing
==================

The Python notes are largely based on "Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" by `Professor Joe Warren <http://report.rice.edu/sir/faculty.detail?p=A2D78585F9777919>`_ et al. The rest of the notes are a complied set from various internet sources.

Notes on Mathematics
====================

The following notes are the beginnings of an attempt at giving equivalent notations.
