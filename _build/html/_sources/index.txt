Notes on CFD
============

These notes are based on "Computational Fluid Dynamics" by `Professor Lorena Barba <http://www.seas.gwu.edu/lorena-barba>`_ and "High Performance Scientific Computing" by `Professor Randall LeVeque <http://depts.washington.edu/amath/staff-members/randy-leveque/>`_. The rest of the notes are based on literature from variously quoted academic resources.
