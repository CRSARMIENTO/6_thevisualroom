\chapter{Introduction}\label{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%

This can be our first chapter. Reviewing the literature is always a good idea!

This thesis template has 40mm margins to the left and 20mm margins everywhere else. We start counting from the title page (page 1) right up to the end of the bibliography.

The sequence things are included are as per the university's guidelines.

\section{How to use BibTex}
%%%%%%%%

Here we can learn about using BibTex.
To use BibTex you need to enter your papers into the {\tt thesis.bib} file in the same manner as the template paper already included.

To setup the bibliography you will need to first run latex, then bibtex and then latex again twice (to make sure the table of contents and references are fine).

i.e. type \\ {\tt latex thesis} \\ {\tt bibtex thesis} \\ {\tt latex thesis} \\ {\tt latex thesis}

or use the shell script provided by typing \\ {\tt lat\_bib thesis}
