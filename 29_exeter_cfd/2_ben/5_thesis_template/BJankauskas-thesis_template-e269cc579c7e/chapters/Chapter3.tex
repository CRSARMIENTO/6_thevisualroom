\subsection{How to cite papers using BibTex}

It is very simple to cite references using BibTex.

Typing\\ {\tt $\backslash$cite\{Blockley\_etal\}}\\ will give you the reference number in brackets --- i.e. \cite{Blockley_etal}.
The references will be numbered in the order you $\backslash$cite them and are automatically listed 	in the Bibliography.
